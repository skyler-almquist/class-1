# Welcome to ENTR-451

This is an example of a GitHub repository.

I am enjoying my class and am having loads of fun. Please make fun of me - I take all jokes seriously. Words do break my bones. 

Very excited to be learning more in this class. 

Testing testing testing.

Gitpod: this is so awesome. TBD on some more changes 

Gitpod: wow this is amazing and the green bars are what is not in the github code. this is purely just here. 

Gitpod: people code here to test the code and then submit back to the repository; this is a trial environment 

Gitpod: this has a timer for 2 hours so always make sure to save this and commit changes.
